# Some examples processing JSON input with XSLT 3.0

Using input samples mostly taken from the [XQuery 3.1 requirements and uses cases](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31-requirements/) and the [XSLT 3.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/) this section shows some XSLT 3.0 samples to process JSON (parsed with `json-doc` or `parse-json`) directly with XSLT to group, sort and/or restructure the JSON.
